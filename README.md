# PantheonsGodMod
A Mod for WorldBox
This Is a mod that adds god traits to the game. I made this Mod in one day, today. Essentially, I saw more use getting active feedback and suggestions than sitting on it for months. As I said I just started modding today so there are some features missing that are probably really quite easy to add. With that being said heres the roadmap

Version 0.1.0:

This is the current skeleton but with all teh features in the comments finally done, that means all gods and traits made breeding, and stat boost

version 1.0++

- Icons
- Ablities/magic (base game)
- Custom visuals and accesories

Version 2.0++

- Custom abilities/magic
- breeding overhaul
-suggestions
-Gui god manager window
